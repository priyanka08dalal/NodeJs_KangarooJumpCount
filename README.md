# NodeJs_KangarooJumpCount

You can download all the dependency by following command in your terminal.

npm i

I used mongo DB database to store the value of Kangaroo position and velocity.

I have created Users in LDAP (Sample Nodejs code) is available in reference Code.

Post API is used to store the data (position and velocity) to database and GET api is use to get the result of the function KangarooJumpCount. This function returns the position
where TWO Kangaroos are at the same position.
